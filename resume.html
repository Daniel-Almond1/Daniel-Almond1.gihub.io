        <p class="text-black">Having accumulated experience in various non-technical roles, I've come to recognize the indispensable role of software in optimizing business operations. The integration of innovative software solutions holds the key to enhancing productivity and efficiency for workers who are receptive to it. As this creates a shift towards leaner and more agile team structures, I have recognized the critical importance of equipping myself with a comprehensive understanding of software.
          <br><br>My coding resume is meant to demonstrate my understanding of software, front and back end, and if you have questions please reach out or ask me on our interview!

          Again thank you for reading and considering my application!
