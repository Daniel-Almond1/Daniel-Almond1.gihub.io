            Since freshman year of high school, I have had the urge to pursue
            business and more specifically real estate. I find it incredibly
            interesting and full of opportunities. My resume highlights relevant
            work I have completed to continue sharpening these skills.

            resume looks out of date or wrong, please use the

            recent version.

            My coding resume should really be called my tech resume because I'm
            less of a coder and more of a technology person. Can I code? Yes! I
            made this website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have also
            completed school and extracurricular projects in Python and Java. I
            enjoy being a problem solver, and coding often helps with that!

            I have been dancing for about 15 years. I started in 7th grade at a
            ballroom studio called Nordquist in Santa Rosa. After graduating
            high school, I left the club and began working at the Santa Rosa
            Arthur Murray studio. There, I was certified and developed into the
            dancer I am today. I still teach and choreograph for the Cal Poly
            Ballroom Dance Team. I don’t plan on stopping dancing and hope to
            eventually run my own studio or club.
