          Notes to read before you look at my resume: I have been lucky to experience critical decision-making that has
          to be undertaken at small to medium-sized businesses. Seeing my mentors and bosses struggle and find success
          has helped me to realize my dream of becoming a business leader. The more I reflect on my past, the more I
          see how life wisdom and life experiences go hand in hand.
          <br><br>
          If you're reading this, know that I'm serious about my future and, if given the chance to work at your company,
          I will go above and beyond not just to impress a higher-up but because I know a strong work ethic will forge my
          success as well as the success of the people around me.

          Having accumulated experience in various non-technical roles, I've come to recognize the indispensable role of
          software in optimizing business operations. The integration of innovative software solutions holds the key to
          enhancing productivity and efficiency for workers who are receptive to it. As this creates a shift towards leaner
          and more agile team structures, I have recognized the critical importance of equipping myself with a comprehensive
          understanding of software.
          <br><br>
          My coding resume is meant to demonstrate my understanding of software, front and back end. If you have questions,
          please reach out or ask me in our interview!
