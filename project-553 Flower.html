          <h3>Project Description/Story</h3>
          <p>
            In June 2021, 553 Flower Avenue was purchased as a fixer-upper requiring substantial renovations. Over the course of four months, the property was transformed into a livable space despite challenges, including worker no-shows and theft at the job site. By November 2021, tenants moved in, and the property began generating income. After a year of rental operations, it was sold in late 2022.
