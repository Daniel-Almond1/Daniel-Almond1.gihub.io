                <p class="text-black">My Name is Daniel Almond. I’m a 23-year-old student at California Polytechnic University. 
                    For the past 3 years after high school, I have been studying and working full-time in various positions. 
                    My experience spans Banking, Sales, Ballroom Dance, and Lots of teaching. Currently, I’m studying business administration with a concentration in information systems and minoring in computer science. 
                    <br/>I’m a part of some excellent programs like Hack4Impact, CS+AI, Polyphonics (Cal Poly’s choir), and even the Ballroom Dance Club.

                    Beyond what I do my cares are mostly academic and experiential. 
                    I believe that I will learn and grow into a valuable asset for the organization I choose to work for. 
                    I want to impact my community positively and have a lasting effect on the people im surrounded with. 
                    
                    Please visit other pages on this website to learn more about me.
                    Cheers!
