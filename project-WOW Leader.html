          <h3>Project Information</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Project Name:</strong> Being a 2024 WOW (Week of Welcome)
            Leader
          </p>
          <p><strong>Date:</strong> Fall Quarter 2024</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Overview:</strong> I was the leader of a group of 35
            incoming transfer students. I planned an entire week and kept the
            trains running for a great WOW experience.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Leadership of 35 transfer students for a full week.</li>
            <li>
              Organized and executed a detailed schedule of events and
              activities.
            </li>
            <li>Ensured the safety and engagement of all group members.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> My WOW group loved the week we spent
            together, and I ended up staying friends with most, if not all, of
            my "Wowies."

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Cal Poly, like many universities, has a Week of Welcome (WOW) where
            incoming students, both freshmen and transfers, are assigned a group
            to spend the week exploring San Luis Obispo with. As a WOW leader, I
            was in charge of everyone's safety and ensuring everyone was having
            a good time.
            <br /><br />
            This was a great leadership experience as managing 35 people
            required strong organizational and communication skills. I also
            learned how to foster a sense of community and belonging among my
            group, which was incredibly rewarding.
