              <li>
                <strong>Risk-Return Analysis:</strong> Apartments offered steady income with low volatility, making them
                ideal for risk-averse investors. In contrast, sectors like data centers provided high returns but were
                accompanied by significant price volatility.

              <li>
                <strong>Volatility Trends:</strong> Lodging and industrial sectors exhibited pronounced price swings,
                especially during economic downturns, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Diversification Benefits:</strong> The correlation matrix underscored the importance of blending
                uncorrelated sectors, such as data centers and timberland, with apartments to balance risk and reward.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Economic Impacts:</strong> Market events such as the 2008 financial crisis and technological
                advancements shaped the performance of various sectors, underscoring the dynamic nature of real estate
                investments.
